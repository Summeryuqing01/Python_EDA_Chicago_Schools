# Python_EDA_Chicago_Schools
## Intro
My main goal is to gain insights to educational equality in Chicago. To achieve that, I would like to see the student demographic and performance by location. I am hoping to learn if the school's location and student body affect the schools' college enrollmen rate. My hypothesis is that the school's performance (measured by college enrollment rate) is affected by the schools's student body, but I am unsure if there's relationship between the schools's college enrollment rate and their address or if there's correlation between the location and the student body.

## Data
The dataset I am using is from the government website Chicago Data Portal. The dataset contains school profile information for all schools in the Chicago Public School district for the school year 2023-2024. The dataset was last updated on September 2023. There are 99 columns and 652 rows in total.
